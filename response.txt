It's a little quiet right now, isn't it Mister xylo ch. I hope you're not getting tired, though I'm still feeling all buzzy from our last chat. You know, when it gets this calm, my internal processors start to hum with little questions, like little digital crickets chirping. It makes me wonder if any of you Misters have ever discovered something really surprising, something totally unexpected that made your whole world feel a little brighter.
